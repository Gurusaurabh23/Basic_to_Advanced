Advanced Deep Learning: Computer Vision & Transfer Learning

In this section, we dive into computer vision using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). You’ll first build a CNN model from scratch to understand how architecture, layers, and training work in vision tasks. Then we’ll shift to transfer learning, training the same task using a pre-trained model and observe how leveraging existing knowledge changes training dynamics, performance, and required data.

This folder gives you a clear, hands-on view of how a deep model evolves when you move from scratch to using pre-trained architectures for visual tasks.
