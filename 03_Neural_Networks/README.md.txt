Neural Network & Deep Learning (Folder 3)

In this section, we transition from classical machine learning into deep learning by working with neural network architectures. You will learn how to build, train, and evaluate neural networks for both regression and classification tasks.

Here’s what you will cover:

Regression using neural networks: Apply a neural net model to a regression problem, to see how it fits continuous targets.

Binary / multiclass classification using neural networks: Train neural networks for classification tasks to distinguish categories.

Fashion MNIST – multiclass classification: Build a neural network model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, covering the full pipeline from input to output classes.

Foundational understanding: From scratch, you’ll grasp how a neural network is structured (layers, activations, weights & biases), how training works (forward pass, loss, backpropagation), and which design/parameter considerations matter.

By the end of this folder, you will have hands-on experience with neural networks in a clear, step-by-step way. You’ll see how they differ from traditional ML models and understand their architectural components and training process.
