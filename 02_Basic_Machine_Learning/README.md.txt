In this folder you’ll begin your journey into Machine Learning using the Python library scikit‑learn (sklearn). We’ll work with regression and classification models, and use standard evaluation metrics to assess their performance.
This is a basic project, aimed at showing you clearly what a machine‑learning workflow looks like — how the model architecture is structured, which parameters matter, and how everything fits together.

You’ll get hands‑on with the following steps:

Choosing and loading a dataset

Preparing the data (features, labels, training/test split)

Selecting a regression or classification model from sklearn

Training/fitting the model

Evaluating the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., for regression or classification)

Identifying key parameters and understanding how they influence model behaviour

By working through this basic example, you’ll gain a solid foundation before diving into more advanced AI techniques and architectures.
