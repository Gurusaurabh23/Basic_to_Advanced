Iâ€™m including pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib in this repository because they are foundational tools for preparing data and visualizing it in machine-learning workflows. Since this repo is designed to cover everything from the basics to advanced AI, these libraries form the core of data handling and exploration.

pandas: A powerful open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use data structures (like DataFrame) and tools to load, clean, reshape, and summarize structured/tabular data. 


NumPy: The fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It offers high-performance multidimensional arrays and mathematical routines (linear algebra, Fourier transforms, etc.), which underpin many higher-level libraries. 


Matplotlib: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It enables you to graphically explore data, which is crucial when building and interpreting machine-learning models.
