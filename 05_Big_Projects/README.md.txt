Final Projects: Bringing It All Together

In this folder, you’ll tackle real projects that combine all the skills and knowledge you’ve built up across the repository:

Food-101 Classification Project — Build a deep learning model to classify 101 different food categories using image data (end-to-end: preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, inference).

Bitcoin Price Prediction – Time Series Projects

Project A: Use classical and deep learning time series methods (e.g. ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future Bitcoin prices based on historical data

Project B: Extend the above by experimenting with multivariate inputs, more advanced architectures (e.g. CNN-LSTM hybrids, 1D CNN, attention), or combining external features to improve forecasting

These projects are the culmination of everything you’ve learned — data handling, machine learning, neural networks, computer vision, and time series modeling. By completing them, you’ll see how all these pieces interlock to create powerful, real-world AI applications.
